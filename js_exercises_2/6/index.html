    <!-- EXAM TYPE EXERCISE: Create a program which recreates a
    bank: meanwhile positive (cash deposit, money is introduced to the
    bank account) and negative (cash withdrawal, money is obtained
    from the bank account ) money amounts (numbers) are introduced
    by the user the bank needs to update the bank account balance (its
    initial value will need to be introduced by the user in the beginning).
    The user will need to indicate that no longer money amounts are
    going to be typed in order to see the final balance.
    Information to be shown in the screen:
    Initial balance: 100 euro
    Cash deposit: 20 euro
    Cash withdrawal: - 10 euro
    Balance due: 110 euro -->
    <h2>BANK</h2>
